# Ray Tracer in One Weekend In Rust

This is an implementation of [Ray Tracer in One Weekend](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf) in Rust instead of C++. Every commit relates to a new code snippet in the book.

To output a result, I simply used `cargo run >> temp.ppm`
